# Stage 2 provisional defaults (the 8 open questions)

These are the adopted provisional answers to the open questions in Section 11 of
the Stage 2 discrimination proposal. They are embedded as the notebook's
defaults and preregistered thresholds. None is settled.

## Q1 — Sample size and categories

**Default:** 5 categories x 10 prompts = 50 synthetic, non-sensitive prompts.
Categories: factual completion, category membership, arithmetic completion,
antonym/negation, multi-token entity continuation. The Stage 1 prompt is item 1
of category 1.

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q2 — Measurement loci

**Default:** keep the Stage 1 loci fixed — layers 6, 13, 20, 26 at position -2 —
with no expansion to all fitted source layers or additional positions.

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q3 — Downstream criterion for "carries information"

**Default:** the model's own next-token output (the `output_baseline`) is the
observational target. No held-out behavioral report task is added in this stage.

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q4 — Preregistered thresholds

**Default:** lock the Section 6 thresholds as embedded in the notebook —
specificity margin `SPECIFICITY_D_MARGIN` = 0.10 on ≥ 80% of prompts
(`SPECIFICITY_MIN_PROMPT_FRACTION` = 0.80) against both control families; added
information `ADDED_INFO_MEDIAN_JACCARD_MAX` = 0.70 median top-10 Jaccard
(Jacobian vs logit-lens) with paired Wilcoxon at `WILCOXON_ALPHA` = 0.01;
same-runtime repeats = 2; inference seeds [0, 1]; random-vector seeds [0, 1, 2].

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q5 — Raw stimulus retention

**Default:** the raw synthetic prompt text is retained in one versioned in-repo
stimulus manifest (`jspace-stage2-stimulus/v1`), while observation artifacts
stay digest-only (`raw_prompt_persisted=false`).

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q6 — Runtime scope

**Default:** single Tesla T4 class only, matching Stage 1. No second
runtime/hardware class is added in this stage; no cross-runtime reproducibility
claim is made.

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q7 — Validator

**Default:** extend `scripts/validate_observation.py` with a
`jspace-observation-discrimination/v1` mode (per-prompt and aggregate) via schema
auto-detection, preserving all existing smoke-test behavior and the stdlib-only
constraint, rather than adding a separate validator.

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.

## Q8 — Execution authorization

**Default:** authoring the Stage 2 notebook is permitted; GPU execution remains
unauthorized. The notebook's measurement cell refuses to run while
`THRESHOLDS_RATIFIED` is False, and the final stage-gate cell states execution is
not authorized until ratification.

Provisional; requires Dr. Mani's ratification before GPU execution.
